# weather-App
I successfully created a Python-based Command-Line Weather App that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. This project is a step towards developing practical applications that combine backend programming and API integration.

💻 Features of the Weather App:
✅ Accepts user input for location (city name or ZIP code)
✅ Displays essential weather details:
🌡️ Temperature
💧 Humidity
🌤️ Weather conditions
✅ Includes error handling for invalid input or network issues

Skills Utilized:
Python programming 🐍
API integration 🌐
Error handling and debugging 🔍
